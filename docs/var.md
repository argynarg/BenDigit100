[Part 2 of first section](section2.2.png)
	When looking at the Frankenstein Variorum Viewer there were a few noticeable sections of text. The first large notable section I found was this section in section 6, where in the MS version this whole section didn’t exist at all. This entire section seems to have been added later to add a bridge between what comes before and the conversation after, and also does a good job of building anticipation for the conversation at hand. There is a progression to the changes here, as before this long series of paragraphs there was one short section in the 1818, 1823, and Thomas versions.

  Similar to the last one, this is yet another section that did not exist in the MS version. The difference is that this one was added entirely in the 1831 edition whereas from 1818 to the publishing of the Thomas edition simply said “Remember me to all my English friends.” This is interesting as the section before, and the section that later replaced it, are speaking to Margaret, while this specific line that was there for a time seems to be addressed to a large group of people, which seems to contradict the point of this letter, thus why it was replaced.

[First issue section](Issue1.png)
  My first issue with the variorum is that when looking at specific sections it is sometimes hard to tell what the section as a whole I wish I could see the areas around the section I’m looking at to see the context for the line I’m analyzing, like for instance to the right you can see that it says that the whole area was simply an “M.” That doesn’t really tell me much so it would be nice to be able to see around that single letter as well.

  Another issue I had was that you can’t change versions the area on the right. It would be nice if you clicked on the area on the right if it actually brought you to that text in the other version so you could compare more easily.
