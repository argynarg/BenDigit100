### Reflection:

while creating the two websites, [using markdown](https://argynarg.github.io/BenDigit100/), and [using WordPress]( https://sites.psu.edu/bensimonportfolio/2020/09/16/hello-world/), I found there was quite a difference between the style of working on the two. To me, both felt somewhat restrictive, though I believe the reasons for this to be very different between the two platforms. Using GitHub and Markdown I feel I was restricted mostly by my lack of Markdown/GitHub knowledge, I feel like there was much more that could have been done with this site had I been more comfortable with GitHub and Markdown. In contrast I felt that WordPress was more restrictive because WordPress seems to be designed very specifically for blogging.
	Honestly after using these to create websites after learning how to use HTML makes me appreciate the freedom HTML gives you so much more, and it makes me want to go back and re-learn html because I feel like the ability to make presentable websites is very important, and the freedoms html gives you with placement and clickable buttons/images and the like helps a website seem more fleshed out compared to the bits of text I have people using the access other pages on these websites.
